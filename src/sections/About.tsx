            I'm Melody, a frontend developer with a strong interest in web
            security. I specialize in building responsive, accessible, and
            visually clean interfaces using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
            My goal is to create user-friendly experiences that are not just
            beautiful â€” but secure by design.
