  description: "Built a modern, responsive React weather application that dynamically displays beautiful background images based on both the searched location's actual weather conditions and local time zone. The app features a sophisticated glass morphism design with a split-panel layout, integrating real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. Key technical achievements include implementing location-aware day/night detection using timezone calculations, creating a favorites system with localStorage persistence, and developing a fully responsive design that works seamlessly across all devices. The application includes a 5-day forecast, detailed weather metrics, and an integrated dark mode toggle. Deployed on Netlify with optimized build processes and SPA routing configuration.",
